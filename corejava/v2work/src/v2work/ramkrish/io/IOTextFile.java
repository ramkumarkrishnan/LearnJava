/**
 * Demo text file input output
 * In the Java API, an object from which we can read a sequence of bytes is
 * called an input stream. An object to which we can write a sequence of bytes
 * is called an output stream. These sources and destinations of byte sequences
 * can be—and often are—files, but they can also be network connections and
 * even blocks of memory. The abstract classes InputStream and OutputStream
 * are the basis for a hierarchy of input/output (I/O) classes.
 * These input/output streams are unrelated to the Streams classes.
 * Byte-oriented input/output streams are inconvenient for processing
 * information stored in Unicode (recall that Unicode uses multiple bytes
 * per character). Therefore, a separate hierarchy provides classes,
 * inheriting from the abstract Reader and Writer classes, for
 * processing Unicode characters.
