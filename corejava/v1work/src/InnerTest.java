/**
 * Demo  inner class
 * Inner class is a class defined inside another class
 * Inner classes can be hidden from other classes in the same package.
 * Inner class methods can access the data from the scope in which they are
 * definedâ€”including the data that would otherwise be private.
 * Inner classes used to be very important for concisely implementing
 * callbacks, but nowadays lambda expressions do a much better job. Still,
 * inner classes can be very useful for structuring your code
