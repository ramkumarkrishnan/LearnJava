/**
 * Do not call the run method of the Thread class or the Runnable object.
 * Calling the run method directly merely executes the task in the same
 * threadâ€”no new thread is started. Instead, call the Thread.start method.
 * It creates a new thread that executes the run method.
 *
 * Do NOT DO THIS:
 * You can also define a thread by forming a subclass of the Thread class, like this:
 * class MyThread extends Thread
 * {
 *    public void run()
 *    {
 *       task code
 *    }
 * }
 * Then you construct an object of the subclass and call its start method. However,
 * this approach is no longer recommended. You should decouple the task that
 * is to be run in parallel from the mechanism of running it. If you have many
 * tasks, it is too expensive to create a separate thread for each of them.
 * Instead, you can use a thread pool.
