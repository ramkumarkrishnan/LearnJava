/**
 * Demo concurrent hashmap
 * uses a concurrent hash map to count all words in the Java files of
 * a directory tree.
 * java provides methods that make atomic updates more convenient.
 * The compute method is called with a key and a function to compute
 * the new value. That function receives the key and the associated value,
 * or null if there is none, and it computes the new value.
 * You cannot have null values in a ConcurrentHashMap. There are many
 * methods that use a null value as an indication that a given key is
 * not present in the map.
 * There are also variants computeIfPresent and computeIfAbsent that only
 * compute a new value when there is already an old one, or when there
 * isnâ€™t yet one.
 * You often need to do something special when a key is added for the
 * first time. The merge method makes this particularly convenient. It
 * has a parameter for the initial value that is used when the key is not yet
 * present. Otherwise, the function that you supplied is called, combining
 * the existing value and the initial value. (Unlike compute, the function
 * does not process the key.) If the function that is passed to compute or
 * merge returns null, the existing entry is removed from the map.
 *
 * The compute method is called with a key and a function to compute the new
 * value. That function receives the key and the associated value, or null
 * if there is none, and it computes the new value. For example, here is how
 * we can update a map of integer counters:
 * map.compute(word, (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);
