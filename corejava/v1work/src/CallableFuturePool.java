/**
 * Demo thread pools and Callable (complement of Runnable) and Futures
 * A Runnable encapsulates a task that runs asynchronously; an asynchronous
 * method with no parameters and no return value. A Callable is similar to
 * a Runnable, but it returns a value. The Callable interface is a
 * parameterized type, with a single method call. The type parameter is the
 * type of the returned value.
 * A Future holds the result of an asynchronous computation. You start a
 * computation, give someone the Future object, and forget about it. The owner
 * of the Future object can obtain the result when it is ready.
 *
 * The Future<V> interface has the following methods:
 * V get()
 * V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
 * void cancel(boolean mayInterrupt)
 * boolean isCancelled()
 * boolean isDone()
 * A call to the first get method blocks until the computation is finished.
 * The second get method also blocks, but it throws a TimeoutException if
 * the call timed out before the computation finished. If the thread running
 * the computation is interrupted, both methods throw an InterruptedException.
 * If the computation has already finished, get returns immediately.
 *
 * The isDone method returns false if the computation is still in progress,
 * true if it is finished.
 *
 * You can cancel the computation with the cancel method. If the computation
 * has not yet started, it is canceled and will never start. If the computation
 * is currently in progress, it is interrupted if the mayInterrupt parameter
 * is true.
 *
 * Canceling a task involves two steps. The underlying thread must be located
 * and interrupted. And the task implementation (in the call method) must sense
 * the interruption and abandon its work. If a Future object does not know
 * on which thread the task is executed, or if the task does not monitor the
 * interrupted status of the thread on which it executes, cancellation will
 * have no effect.
 *
 * The newCachedThreadPool method constructs a thread pool that executes
 * each task immediately, using an existing idle thread when available and
 * creating a new thread otherwise. The newFixedThreadPool method constructs
 * a thread pool with a fixed size. If more tasks are submitted than there are
 * idle threads, the un-served tasks are placed on a queue. They are run when
 * other tasks have completed. The newSingleThreadExecutor is a degenerate
 * pool of size 1 where a single thread executes the submitted tasks, one
 * after another. These three methods return an object of the ThreadPoolExecutor
 * class that implements the ExecutorService interface.
 * Use a cached thread pool when you have threads that are short-lived or spend
 * a lot of time blocking. However, if you have threads that are working hard
 * without blocking, you donâ€™t want to run a large number of them together.
 * For optimum speed, the number of concurrent threads is the number of processor
 * cores. In such a situation, you should use a fixed thread pool that bounds
 * the total number of concurrent threads.
 * The single-thread executor is useful for performance analysis. If you
 * temporarily replace a cached or fixed thread pool with a single-thread pool,
 * you can measure how much slower your application runs without the benefit of
 * concurrency.
 * Java EE provides a ManagedExecutorService subclass that is suitable for
 * concurrent tasks in a Java EE environment. Similarly, web frameworks
 * such as Play provide executor services that are intended for tasks within
 * the framework.
 *
 * You can submit a Runnable or Callable to an ExecutorService with one of the
 * following methods:
 * Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
 * Future<?> submit(Runnable task)
 * Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result)
 * The pool will run the submitted task at its earliest convenience.
 * When you call submit, you get back a Future object that you can use to get
 * the result or cancel the task.
 *
 * The second submit method returns an odd-looking Future<?>. You can use such
 * an object to call isDone, cancel, or isCancelled, but the get method simply
 * returns null upon completion.
 *
 * The third version of submit yields a Future whose get method returns the
 * given result object upon completion. When you are done with a thread pool,
 * call shutdown. This method initiates the shutdown sequence for the pool.
 * An executor that is shut down accepts no new tasks. When all tasks are
 * finished, the threads in the pool die. Alternatively, you can call
 * shutdownNow. The pool then cancels all tasks that have not yet begun.
 *
 * Here, in summary, is what you do to use a thread pool:
 *
 * Call the static newCachedThreadPool or newFixedThreadPool method of the Executors class.
 * Call submit to submit Callable or Runnable objects.
 * Hang on to the returned Future objects so that you can get the results or cancel the tasks.
 * Call shutdown when you no longer want to submit any tasks.
 *
 * The ScheduledExecutorService interface has methods for scheduled or repeated
 * execution of tasks. It is a generalization of java.util.Timer that allows for
 * thread pooling. The newScheduledThreadPool and newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor
 * methods of the Executors class return objects that implement the
 * ScheduledExecutorService interface.
 *
 * You can schedule a Runnable or Callable to run once, after an initial delay.
 * You can also schedule a Runnable to run periodically.
